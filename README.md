# scammy-bbp
Bug bounty programs that are "scammy" or unethical can sometimes involve promising rewards to researchers for identifying security flaws, but either delay payments, don't pay at all, or misuse the disclosed vulnerabilities. 


Signs of a Potentially Scammy Bug Bounty Program:

- Unclear Terms and Conditions: Programs that don't clearly specify what vulnerabilities qualify for rewards or the amount of the reward.
- No Transparent Payment Structure: Lack of details about payment timelines, payout methods, or cases where people report not getting paid.
- Little to No Community Feedback: Lack of reputation or negative reviews from the infosec community.
